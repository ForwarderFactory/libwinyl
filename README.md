# libwinyl

This library was more or less taken from https://codeberg.org/libwinyl/libwinyl.
I do not take any credit for the actual code, I merely threw away the Makefile
and added a proper CMakeLists.txt so that the library can be built with CMake.

The Makefile already had a target for generating a CMakeLists.txt, which is
confusing because usually you would generate a Makefile from a CMakeLists.txt, 
not the other way around.

I plan on contributing this back to the original repository, but as of now I have
no contact information for the original author.

The original library is licensed under the MIT license, and thus; I am licensing
this library under the same license. See LICENSE for more information.
